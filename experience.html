      <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
      <p>
        It all started in middle school with BASIC, followed by building websites in high school.
        Since then, I've reengineered fraud detection platforms, built real-time bidding systems,
        led projects at Shopify like the Shopless Billing API refactor and Performance Tripwires,
        and crafted full-stack solutions for clients globally.
