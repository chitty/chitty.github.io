      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a full stack engineer with a passion for solving real-world problems through technology. I've worked at
        scale with companies like Shopify, traveled the world while building software remotely, and contributed to
        open-source communities. I'm driven by purpose, community, and continuous learning.</p>
      <br>

      <p>I aim to live intentionally and build tools that simplify and improve life. I'm passionate about education,
        wellness, fitness, financial markets, community, and family. I'm currently looking for place where I can grow as
        an engineer and a
        human, surrounded by people who care about making a difference.</p>

      <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
      <p>
        It all started in middle school with BASIC, followed by building websites in high school.

        led projects at Shopify like the Shopless Billing API refactor and Performance Tripwires,
        and crafted full-stack solutions for clients globally.
